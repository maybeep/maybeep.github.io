## Technologies &amp; Concepts Mastered
- **Basics of the Web**
    - **HTML:** I made an [HTML Reference Guide](html_site.html) in HTML. 
        - I used tables to organize HTML tags with their explanations. 
        - I learned about HTML escape characters so I could print tags such as &lt;strong&gt;. 
        - I became comfortable with both block and inline nesting by emphasizing certain words, using tables, structuring my site using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags, etc.
        - Learned about inline styles by making the tables have different background colors.
    - **CSS:** I made a pretty [website](brian_css.html) bragging about my dog Brian.
        - I used &lt;style&gt; tags to add background color to the header and different sections of the body. Changed font and font size of the body text.
        - Spent way too long figuring out how to horizontally align three images in the center of the page.
        - Eventually learned the difference between padding and margins.
        - Used percentages for image dimensions to make my site more responsive.
    - **JavaScript:** 
- **React:**
    -
- **Git**
    - Learned in class on 9/9 that there is a local way of viewing my site. Before, I kept making extremely small edits, submitting to Git, waiting for my site to refresh, then finally reloading my site to see my change. This is obviously extremely inefficient compared to opening html_site.html locally and seeing my changes immediately. Now I can make Git commits often rather than *constantly*.
