## Technologies &amp; Concepts Mastered

- Basics of the Web
    - **HTML:** I made an [HTML Reference Guide](html_site.html) in HTML. 
        - I used tables to organize HTML tags with their explanations. 
        - I learned about HTML escape characters so I could print tags such as &lt;strong&gt;. 
        - I became comfortable with both block and inline nesting by emphasizing certain words, using tables, structuring my site using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags, etc.
        - Learned about inline styles by making the tables have different background colors.
    - **CSS:** I made a pretty [website](brian_css.html) bragging about my dog Brian.
    - **JavaScript:** 

## TODO
- Project for CSS: Website about Brian?
